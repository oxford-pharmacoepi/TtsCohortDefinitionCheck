# Manage project dependencies ------
# install.packages("renv") # if not already installed, install renv from CRAN
# the following will prompt you to install the various packages used in the study 
renv::activate()
renv::restore() 

# Load packages ------
# load r packages
library(SqlRender)
library(DatabaseConnector)
library(here)
library(DBI)
library(dbplyr)
library(dplyr)
library(RPostgres)
library(log4r)

# Set output folder location -----
# the path to a folder where the results from this analysis will be saved
# to set the location within the project with folder called "ouput, we can use: here("output")
# but this file path could be set to somewhere else
output.folder<-here("output")

# Set the name/ acronym for your database (to be used in the titles of reports, etc) -----
db.name<-"....."

# Specify OHDSI DatabaseConnector connection details  ------
# set up the createConnectionDetails to connect to the database
# see http://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector for more details
connectionDetails <- DatabaseConnector::createConnectionDetails(dbms = "....",
                                                                server ="....", #eg "10.80...../mypostgres"
                                                                user = "....",
                                                                password = "....",
                                                                port = "....",

# Specify DBI connection details -----
# In this study we also use the DBI package to connect to the database
# set up the dbConnect details below (see https://dbi.r-dbi.org/articles/dbi for more details)
# you may need to install another package for this (although RPostgres is included with renv in case you are using postgres)

db <- dbConnect("...")
# eg for postgres 
# db <- dbConnect(RPostgres::PostgreSQL(),
#                 dbname = "....", #eg "mypostgres" (without the "10.80...../" used in DatabaseConnector)
#                 port = "....",
#                 host = "....", 
#                 user = "....", 
#                 password = "....")




# Set database details -----

# your sql dialect used with the OHDSI SqlRender package
# eg “postgresql”, “redshift”, etc
# see https://ohdsi.github.io/SqlRender/articles/UsingSqlRender.html for more details
targetDialect <-"....."  

# The name of the schema that contains the OMOP CDM with patient-level data
cdm_database_schema<-"....."

# The name of the schema that contains the vocabularies 
# (often this will be the same as cdm_database_schema)
vocabulary_database_schema<-"....."

# The name of the schema where results tables will be created 
results_database_schema<-"....."

# Tables to be created in your results schema for this analysis will be named using this as the stem 
# Note, any existing tables in your results schema with the same names will be overwritten
cohortTableStem<-"IdentifyingTTS"

# Check database connections -----
# to check whether the OHDSI DatabaseConnector worked, uncomment and run the below three lines
# conn <- connect(connectionDetails)
# querySql(conn,paste0("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ", cdm_database_schema, ".person"))
# disconnect(conn)

# to check the DBI worked, uncomment and run the below line
# tbl(db, sql(paste0("SELECT * FROM ",cdm_database_schema, ".person"))) %>% tally()

# in both cases, you should have a count of people in the database printed back in the console

# Run the study ------
source(here("RunStudy.R"))

# after the study is run you should have a zip folder in your output folder to share
